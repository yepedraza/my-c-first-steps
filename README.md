# My C++ first steps

Here are my first programs developed in my programming class in C ++ language. Most were created since 2017. I made a compilation of what seems to me, the best practical exercises that I did according to the following topics:

* Conditionals
* One-dimensional arrays
* Two-dimensional arrays
* Pointers
* Character strings
* Inheritance

They may not be very complex programs, but perhaps for people who are just beginning to program and find it difficult, they could be very helpful ðŸ˜Š.

_These programs were developed in Visual Studio with the concept of projects but, for simplicity, I decided to upload only the statements and files with the .cpp extension_
